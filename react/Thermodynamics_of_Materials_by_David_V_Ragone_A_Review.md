The first volume covers the statistical and classical thermodynamics of solids, including enthalpy, entropy, energy exchange, and more. It also examines the property relationships of solids, such as chemical potentials, heat capacity, compressibility, magnetism, and others. The book further explores the equilibrium states and electrochemistry of solid materials, providing the essential information necessary to work with them in theoretical and practical applications.
 
The second volume focuses on the thermodynamics of phase transformations and chemical reactions in solids. It covers topics such as phase diagrams, diffusion, nucleation, solidification, precipitation, martensitic transformations, order-disorder phenomena, oxidation, corrosion, and electrochemical cells. The book also discusses the thermodynamics of multicomponent systems and alloys, as well as the thermodynamics of defects and nonstoichiometric compounds.
 
The book is written in a clear and concise style, with numerous examples and problems to illustrate the concepts and applications. The book also includes extensive appendices that provide essential formulas and reference lists for current, volume, pressure, energy, and more. The book is suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, as well as researchers and practitioners in the field of material science.

Thermodynamics of Materials is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the thermodynamic principles and applications of solid materials. The book covers a wide range of topics, from the fundamentals of statistical and classical thermodynamics, to the complex phenomena of phase transformations and chemical reactions. The book also provides a thorough treatment of multicomponent systems and nonideal solutions, as well as the thermodynamics of defects and nonstoichiometric compounds. The book is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear explanations and illustrations. The book also includes many solved and unsolved problems that test the reader's understanding and reinforce the learning outcomes.
 
The book is highly recommended for students, researchers, and engineers who want to learn more about the thermodynamics of materials and its applications in various fields, such as metallurgy, ceramics, polymers, semiconductors, nanomaterials, and more. The book is also a useful reference for teachers and instructors who want to use a comprehensive and up-to-date textbook for their courses on thermodynamics of materials.

One of the main features of Thermodynamics of Materials is its emphasis on the connection between thermodynamics and other disciplines of material science, such as kinetics, structure, and properties. The book shows how thermodynamics can be used to predict and explain the behavior of materials under various conditions, such as temperature, pressure, composition, and external fields. The book also shows how thermodynamics can be used to design and optimize materials for specific applications, such as energy conversion, storage, and transmission.
 
Another feature of Thermodynamics of Materials is its coverage of the latest developments and advances in the field of thermodynamics of materials. The book incorporates the most recent experimental and theoretical results, as well as the current trends and challenges in the field. The book also discusses the emerging topics and areas of research in thermodynamics of materials, such as nanothermodynamics, thermoelectrics, thermophotovoltaics, and more.
